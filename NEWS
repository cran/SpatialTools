#Changes

#0.5.7 Fixed bug in calculation of Gaussian covariance function.

#0.5.6 Updated DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE 

#0.5.5 Updated DESCRIPTION so that Rcpp and RcppArmadillo are not included in binary builds of the package.

#0.5.4 Updated namespace so that the spBayes package is imported, but is not a depends since it is only required for one function.

#0.5.3  Modified spLMPredictJoint function to rely on C++ for much faster computation.

#0.5.2  Corrected bug in cov.sp when user-supplied distance matrices are supplied.  Added spLMPredictJoint function.

#0.5.1 Modified simple.cov.sp for much faster computation times of spherical and 
       matern covariance functions.  Added matern2 covariance function, an alternative 	parameterization from Handcock and Wallis (1994).

#0.5.0	Cleaned the arguments for kriging functions.  Added functions related to contour
       lines.  Added rcondnorm to simulate from multivariate normal distribution
	conditional on observed data.

#0.4.3	Changed krige.uk to pure R (with little change in speed).  Updated distance
	functions to reference namespace to improve compatibility with old versions of R.

#0.4.2	Removed rcondsim and condsim.par functions.  Removed ability to return weight
	matrix from krige.uk, krige.ok, krige.sk.

#0.4.1	Added check on rcondsim arguments.  Fixed small bug in maxlik.cov.st.

#0.4.0	Added rcondsim to simulate from conditional distribution.
	Added ability to simulate from conditional distribution
	in krige.sk, krige.ok, and krige.uk.

#0.3.5
	Fixed bug in krige_ok (cpp version) that cropped up due to 
	some changes related to RcppArmadillo.
	Reorganized cpp, h files for kriging functions.

#0.3.4
	Added coincident function to determine coincident locations.

#0.3.3 
	Added krige.sk function to perform simple kriging.
	Fixed bug in cov.st for separable ar1 process with nugget
	Various corrections in the man files
